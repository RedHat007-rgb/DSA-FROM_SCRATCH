## Problem 1: Print in Reverse

**Description**:
Given an array of integers, print the elements of the array in reverse order.

**Input**:
- The first line contains an integer `N` (1 \<= N \<= 1000), the size of the array.
- The second line contains `N` space-separated integers.

**Output**:
- Print the elements of the array in reverse order, separated by spaces.

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output:
5 4 3 2 1
```

## Problem 2: Position of Element B

**Description**:
Find the first occurrence of the element `B` in the array. If the element does not exist, print `-1`.

**Input**:
- The first line contains an integer `N` (1 \<= N \<= 1000), the size of the array.
- The second line contains `N` space-separated integers.
- The third line contains the integer `B`.

**Output**:
- Print the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `B`. If `B` is not found, print `-1`.

**Example**:
```
Input:
6
1 3 5 7 9 11
7
Output:
4
```

## Problem 3: 1D Arrays MCQ D

**Description**:
Evaluate a multiple-choice question (MCQ) about 1D arrays. You will be given an array and a set of options. Determine the correct answer based on the question description.

**Input**:
- The first line contains an integer `N` (1 \<= N \<= 1000), the size of the array.
- The second line contains `N` space-separated integers.
- The third line describes the question and options.

**Output**:
- Print the correct answer based on the provided options.

**Example**:
```
Input:
4
10 20 30 40
Question: What is the sum of all elements?
Options: A) 100 B) 90 C) 110 D) 120
Output:
A
```

## Problem 4: Is X Present?

**Description**:
Check whether a given integer `X` is present in the array.

**Input**:
- The first line contains an integer `N` (1 \<= N \<= 1000), the size of the array.
- The second line contains `N` space-separated integers.
- The third line contains the integer `X`.

**Output**:
- Print `Yes` if `X` is present, otherwise print `No`.

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
4 8 15 16 23
15
Output:
Yes
```

## Problem 5: Sum the Array

**Description**:
Compute the sum of all elements in the array.

**Input**:
- The first line contains an integer `N` (1 \<= N \<= 1000), the size of the array.
- The second line contains `N` space-separated integers.

**Output**:
- Print the sum of all elements in the array.

**Example**:
```
Input:
4
5 10 15 20
Output:
50
```

## Problem 6: Max and Min of an Array

**Description**:
Find the maximum and minimum values in the array.

**Input**:
- The first line contains an integer `N` (1 \<= N \<= 1000), the size of the array.
- The second line contains `N` space-separated integers.

**Output**:
- Print two space-separated integers: the maximum and minimum values in the array.

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
12 3 45 7 8
Output:
45 3
```

## Problem 7: Frequency of X in Array

**Description**:
Determine how many times a given integer `X` appears in the array.

**Input**:
- The first line contains an integer `N` (1 \<= N \<= 1000), the size of the array.
- The second line contains `N` space-separated integers.
- The third line contains the integer `X`.

**Output**:
- Print the frequency of `X` in the array.

**Example**:
```
Input:
6
1 2 3 2 4 2
2
Output:
3
```
